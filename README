## Development

Development initially started on an app called Table Ready, which used an API to scan the ID of a customer at a restaurant to get their informaiton and create a profile of them for the restaurant. MVP included functionality to put the customer on a waitlist and send a text to them when their table was ready. The project was scrapped early due to issues with the ID scanning OCR API.

Development shifted to the current MVP, Dinner For You. Using integrated Github kanban board team split tasks into user interface, recipe history, client side storage, and the API calls. Team communicated well to build components separately and then join them to create seamless app.

## Future Development

Additional features -

- "Clear" or "Delete" functionality for recipe history buttons
- Dynamically generate site headers "Meal", "Category", "Region", "Ingredients", "Measure", "Instructions" to clean up UI when app loads.
